The Django DataTables library provides a reusable Django application to easily
integrate the DataTables jQuery plugin into a project.

It is currently considered an alpha release.  It works for me for a few
projects, but may not be ready for your production application.  The classes,
functions and parameters are subject to change in future releases.

It is tested against Python 2.6 and Python 2.7 using Django 1.4, 1.5 and 1.6.

To get started with the test_project, use the following commands to setup your
test database and run the development server:

    ./manage.py syncdb --migrate
    ./manage.py loaddata fortunecookies
    ./manage.py runserver

Then connect to http://localhost:8044/ to view the sample datatable.
